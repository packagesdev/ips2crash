## Synopsis

ips2crash is a macOS command line too to convert a .ips file to a legacy .crash log file.

## Motivation

It should be possible to read .ips file on macOS releases earlier than Monterey.

Minimum OS requirement is macOS 10.9 at this time.

## Development Environment

- macOS 10.14 or later
- Xcode 10.1 or later
- Objective-C 2.x

## To do

- Unit tests
- Support for summary

## Note

- The translation to a report version 12 looks to be more accurate than the one made by Apple in Monterey.
